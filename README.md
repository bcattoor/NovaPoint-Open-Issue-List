# NovaPoint-Open-Issue-List
Open transparant, and available for everyone.

## Why this repository
The last 5 years or so I have been working (commissioned by Infrabel) together with [vianova-systems.be](vianova-systems.be) to tackle *issue's, problems and enhancements* for the software product that is called *Novapoint BASE*, and the supplementary module that runs on top of AutoCAD, *Novapoint RAILWAY*.

What I want to accomplish with this repository is setting up a **light weight issue tracker**, that is **available for everyone** around the world, making **all information transparent** and **accessible** to **all**.

## Disclaimer
This is in no way an **official way of asking for support** for any of the above mentioned software products. If you would like official support for those products please contact their support teams.

**The maintainer of this repository is not responsible for the content that is within this repository and its issue tracker.**
